### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

    - Yes, the lab topics provided a strong foundation for building this project, especially in understanding how to work with APIs, manage state with React hooks, and design responsive components using CSS Flexbox and Grid. However, I felt somewhat unprepared for implementing the embedded trailer functionality within the modal. While we briefly discussed modals and event handling, integrating an external video source and dynamically fetching trailer content from the API required additional research and troubleshooting beyond what was covered in the labs.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
    - If I had more time, I would have added the “Favorite” and “Watched” features to improve interactivity and personalization for the user. I would also refine the UI animations, especially for the modal transitions, to enhance the user experience. Additionally, I would implement persistent state (e.g., using localStorage or a backend) so that users’ favorites and watched lists would be saved across sessions.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

    - The demo went well overall—features like the search bar, modal popup, and sort functionality worked smoothly and as intended. Watching my peers’ demos, I was inspired by the use of animated transitions and unique theming styles, which made their apps feel more polished. In future projects, I’d like to experiment more with creative design touches and user interface animations.
